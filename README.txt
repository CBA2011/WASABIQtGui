1a. Compiling
This program can be compiled as using "Qt Creator" version 2.3.0 (MinGW4.4, Qt4.7.3)
under MS Windows 7. It depends on Qt, OpenGL, and the WASABIEngine as dynamically linked libraries.
The first two come with the Qt SDK, but the last one needs to be downloaded and compiled from GitHub separately.
To compile the program yourself it might be easiest to download the free "Qt SDK" and then
open the WASABIQtGUI.pro file.

1b. Running
As mentioned above, this project depends on the presence of the WASABIEngine library.
For MS Windows environments, you may need to copy the "WASABIEngine.dll" from the corrsponding
build-directory of that project, into the build project of this project (debug and/or release) manually.
Furthermore, as it depends on your choice of options in QtCreator which directory structure will be
generated by the development environment, you might also have to copy the following initialization
files to the same folder as the executable (debug and/or release again):
- WASABI.ini
- *.emo_dyn
- *.emo_pad
- *.se
These file(types) can be found in the source folder alongsight all the other sources.

2. Documentation
I used doxygen to compile an html documentation from the source code. It can be found in
"WASABIEngine\doxygen\html".

3. Additional information
To get additional information about WASABI, reading my PhD thesis might be helpful.
