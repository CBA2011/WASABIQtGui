1a. Setup
This program can be compiled as using "Qt Creator" version 2.4.1 (MinGW4.6.2, Qt4.7.4) under MS Windows 7. It depends on Qt, OpenGL, QWT (http://qwt.sourceforge.net/), and the WASABIEngine as dynamically linked libraries.
The first two come with the Qt SDK. The last two are integrated as submudules.
After a fresh clone of this project, you will only have the empty subdirectories "WASABIEngine" and "WASABI-qwt-clone" and compiling will fail. Thus, perform:
$ git submodule update --init "WASABIEngine"
$ git submodule update --init "WASABI-qwt-clone"

1b. Compiling

-- Win7 --

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to change the setting of every project to use the "MinGW (32bit)" toolchain and not the option "MinGW as a gcc for Windows targets" under Projects->Goals->Build configurations->Toolchains". In addition, currently only the RELEASE configuration seems to work. So, please also change to "release" configuration in each project.
Then proceed as follows:
A1. open the file "\WASABI-qwt-clone\qwt-code\qwt\qwt.pro" in QtCreator don't using "shadow build".
A2. change the Toolchain setting as explained above for both the debug and release configuration.
A3. change to the release configuration (left panel button)
A4. "build" the project (Ctrl-B). This will take some time.
B1. open the file "\WASABIEngine\WASABIEngine.pro" in QtCreator don't using "shadow build".
B2. change the Toolchain setting as explained above for both the debug and release configuration.
B3. change to the release configuration (left panel button)
B4. "build" the project (Ctrl-B). This won't take too long.
C1. set the project "WASABIGuiQt" to be the "active project" (right-click menu)
C2. change the Toolchain setting as explained above for both the debug and release configuration.
C3. change to the release configuration (left panel button)
C4. press the play button to compile and run.

Take a look at the WASABIGuiQt.pro file, if you run into trouble. The system expects to find the "WASABIEngine.dll" in the directory "WASABIEngine\release" subdirectory. The qwt.dll should reside in the "WASABI-qwt-clone/qwt-code/qwt/lib" subdirectory.

to be described soon.

1c. Running

-- Win7 --

Starting directly from within QtCreator should work out-of-the-box. If you want to start the executable, you may have to copy the dlls into the same folder as the executable, i.e., the release/debug directories. Furthermore, as it depends on your choice of options in QtCreator which directory structure will be generated by the development environment, you might also have to copy the following initialization files to the same folder as the executable (debug and/or release again):
- WASABI.ini
- *.emo_dyn
- *.emo_pad
- *.se
These file(types) can be found in the source folder alongside the sources.

-- Linux --

TODO: needs to be updated..
In case of a linux environment, I found that the "WASABIGuiQt" executable seems to expect the WASABIEngine library in "/usr/lib" (as the output of "ldd WASABIGuiQt" told me). Thus, after manually copying the library (together with the symbolic links, "sudo cp lib* /usr/lib") to that folder, the Gui runs fine. Sorry for this inconvenience. If anybody nows how to automate/fix this, please let me now.

2. Documentation
I used doxygen to compile an html documentation from the source code. It can be found in
"WASABIEngine\doxygen\html".

3. Additional information
To get additional information about WASABI, reading my PhD thesis might be helpful.
